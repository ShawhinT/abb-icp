# Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Analysis

This repository contains code for creating an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) for my AI Builders Bootcamp. It uses real student data (e.g. job title, company, join reason) to predict the user engagement and course KPIs. The results are then synthesized into a [final ICP](https://github.com/ShawhinT/abb-icp/blob/main/data/4-icp/icp.md), which can be repurposed for sales and marketing.

## Steps

1. **Data Preparation**: Combines and cleans student data from multiple cohorts
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creates meaningful features from raw data using AI classification
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Uses logistic regression to identify factors that predict high ratings
4. **Predictor Analysis**: Interpreting top variables from logistic regression model and qualitative analysis with GPT-4.1
5. **ICP Generation**: Creates a detailed ideal customer profile using GPT-4.1
