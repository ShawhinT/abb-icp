    - leader: Works at a company, leads managers (e.g. directors, VPs, heads, CXOs)
      - Examples: director, vp, vice president, chief, cfo, ceo, coo, cto, cmo, executive, head, senior director, managing director, president, partner

    - entrepreneur: Works for themselves, founders, independent consultants, freelancers
      - Examples: founder, co-founder, owner, entrepreneur, self-employed, independent consultant, business owner, startup, freelancer, solo founder

    - student: In school, research assistant, or intern
      - Examples: student, intern, graduate student, phd, undergraduate, bachelor, master, mba, candidate, doctoral, research assistant, teaching assistant

Instructions:
- Use the keywords above to guide your classification.
- If a job title matches multiple categories, assign the highest-priority category according to this order:
    1. entrepreneur
    2. leader
    3. manager
    4. ic
    5. student
- Use company size only if it helps resolve ambiguity (e.g., “President” at a 2-person company = entrepreneur, but at a 500+ company = leader).
- If no match, classify as ic by default.
- Return your answer in this JSON format:

  }
