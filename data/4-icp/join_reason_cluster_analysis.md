### Key Differences: Cluster 4 vs. Others
Cluster 4 customers tend to be more engaged in the course material and leave 5-star reviews.

**1. Depth and Specificity of Goals**

- **Cluster 4:**  
  - Highly specific, technical, and **application-oriented** goals.
  - Participants mention concrete **technologies** (e.g., LLMs, RAG, tokenization, open-source models, XGBoost, hosting environments).
  - Desire to understand detailed processes like **model fine-tuning**, training with private datasets, and deployment (locally or cloud).
  - Several want to make informed choices about frameworks and tools.

- **Other Clusters:**
  - Generally **broader or more generic** goals.
  - Focus on wanting "hands-on experience," "AI basics," "career transition," or "understanding AI applications."
  - Some mention tool names (e.g., Cluster 1 citing LLMs, RAG, Hugging Face), but not in the context of an end-to-end application pipeline.
  - Many entries about "improving resumes," "gaining knowledge," "building practical skills," without specifying complex technical goals.

**2. Level of Technical Experience**

- **Cluster 4:**  
  - Appears to cater to **intermediate to advanced learners** who already have some background and now wish to:
    - Deep-dive into **methodologies**.
    - Make decisions (e.g., tool/model selection, environment comparison).
    - Understand all steps from data ingestion to deployment.
  - Less focus on "basics," more on **optimization and value generation**.

- **Other Clusters:**  
  - Encompasses a wide spectrum: from **newcomers and career changers** (Clusters 5, part of 1) to those wanting to "become AI enabled" or "start with basics."
  - Broader appeal—fits career upskilling, portfolio building, or general familiarity with AI.

**3. Profession/Background**

- **Cluster 4:**
  - Includes job categories like "ic" (individual contributors), "entrepreneur," "leader."
  - Several statements around transitioning into data science, building as a data scientist, or supporting organizational/data value goals.
  - Some have teaching backgrounds or are seeking to leverage existing expertise into AI consulting or specialist roles.

- **Other Clusters:**  
  - Broader job mix—students, product managers, software engineers, business leaders, those exploring AI for use in non-technical careers.
  - More focused on **career change** or **career growth.**

---

**4. Application Domains and Use Cases**

- **Cluster 4:**  
  - Emphasis on building **high-ROI, real-world AI applications**.
  - Multiple mentions of **app/tool creation**, **custom dataset training**, and **company environment comparison**.
  - Stronger focus on value realization from AI, not just learning for its own sake.

- **Other Clusters:**  
  - Application areas are mentioned (e.g., AI for small business, product management, regulatory compliance, etc.) but tend to be higher-level, exploratory, or aspirational.
  - Many express intent to **learn enough to get started** or know what is possible, rather than execute complex projects.
